First repository ever.
First repository ever. I'm kinda bored and I just finished watching Stranger Things, so I told myself "Why don't you learn something?". I kinda came across this looking for another thing, but it's cool.

Also I'm following the tutorial here so expect a lot of bullshit being done and written. (Like this, actually.)
